# LaskaKit USB-C Adapter

Need to easily connect your board to a computer or power adapter with USB-C? We've designed a tiny but fully versatile board called the [LaskaKit USB-C Adapter](https://www.laskakit.cz/laskakit--usb-c-adapter/) for just these cases.

On the 21x20x5mm board you'll find a universal USB-C connector that you can connect to your computer via cable, and on the other side you'll find our USB-C connector. Depending on the variant you buy, you can then connect the USB data and power pins to [the male header](https://www.laskakit.cz/--sup--stemma-qt--qwiic-jst-sh-4-pin-kabel-dupont-samice/) or [directly to the non-soldering field (breadboard)](https://www.laskakit.cz/--sup--stemma-qt--qwiic-jst-sh-4-pin-kabel-dupont-samec/).

If you want to solder the board somewhere or choose a different type of connection to your board, then you can use the unmounted 2x3 holes in the common 2.54mm pitch will work fine.

The module has TVS protection diodes with Vbr (Breakdown Voltage) 5.6V.

For pins CC1 and CC2 we have fitted pull-down resistors of value 5k1 - which for (for example) a charger means that it can allow power up to 15W (5V/3A).
